# Machine-Learning-Stats-Assessment

## Introduction
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that perform statistical analysis on a dataset. The notebooks focus on t-test analysis and regression analysis.

## Notebooks

### 1. ttest.ipynb
This notebook covers the following aspects:

- **Introduction**: An overview of the project and the dataset.
- **Analysis of the Data**: A breakdown of each column in the dataset, providing insights into the data's composition.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examination of the correlation between all data columns to identify any significant associations.
- **T-Test Analysis**: Implementation of the t-test to compare groups within the dataset.
- **T-Test Results**: Presentation of the outcomes of the t-test and interpretation of the results.
- **References**: A list of references used in the analysis.

### 2. regression.ipynb
This notebook focuses on regression analysis:
- **Introduction**: An overview of the project and the dataset.
- **Data Preparation**: A view of all the libraries used and loading the data. 
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Examination of the correlation between all data columns to identify any significant associations.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of the Linear Regressin Model to compare the data within the dataset.
- **Other Model**: Presentation of the outcomes of the Random Forest Model and the K Nearest Neighbour Model and the interpretation of the results.
- **In an Ideal World**: Presentation of a simulated data set where when the years of service increased the salary increased. The same models above were used on the fake data to see the outcome. 
- **References**: A list of references used in the analysis.

## Getting Started
To access and run the notebooks on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/Cossie01/Machine-Learning-Stats-Assessment.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ttest.ipynb`
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks using your preferred environment.

## Usage
Each notebook is designed to be self-contained, guiding you through the analysis process step by step. Run the code cells in sequence to reproduce the analyses.
